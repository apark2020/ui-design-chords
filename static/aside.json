    "point2": "There are two general types of Keys: Major and Minor: Major scales are defined by the interval pattern of: W W H W W W H (Play); Minor scales are defined by the interval pattern of: W H W W H W W (Play)",
    "point3": "So why do keys matter in our learning? The same progression can sound slightly different based on the song's key—focus on the music's overall vibe/shape, rather than a direct 1-to-1 comparison"
